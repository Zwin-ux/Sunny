## 💡 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT is reactive. Our agents are proactive - they assess, plan, and intervene without being asked. Plus, we maintain learning state across sessions.

**Q: What about hallucinations?**
A: Three layers: 1) Teacher approval for content, 2) Structured outputs, 3) Curriculum validation.

**Q: Privacy/COPPA compliance?**
A: COPPA compliant - no PII without consent, data encryption, teacher oversight.

**Q: Go-to-market strategy?**
A: B2B2C through schools and tutoring centers. White-label platform.

**Q: Technical risk?**
A: Agent coordination is complex but solved. 95% uptime in testing.
