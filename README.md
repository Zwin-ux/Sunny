## Customizing Lesson Plans

The application uses a structured format for lesson plans that makes them easy to create and modify:

3. **Activities**: Interactive exercises of different types (multiple-choice, creative, discussion)
4. **Resources**: Additional materials to supplement the lesson

Each lesson plan is fully customizable and can include:

- Multiple activities with varying difficulty levels
- Age-appropriate content targeting specific grade ranges
- Visual aids using the included image library
- Related topics for extended learning
