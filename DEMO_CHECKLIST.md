## 🎭 Handling Questions

### **"How does it work?"**
→ "Five specialized AI agents continuously analyze how the child learns and adapt the teaching approach in real-time."

### **"What makes it autonomous?"**
→ "Traditional AI tutors wait for you to ask for help. Sunny detects when you're struggling and intervenes automatically - just like a human teacher would."

### **"Is it safe for kids?"**
→ "Absolutely. Content is age-appropriate, filtered, and designed for kids 6-10. Plus, parents have full visibility into progress."

### **"What if my child is ahead/behind?"**
→ "That's the beauty of Sunny - it automatically adjusts difficulty. If they're breezing through, it increases challenge. If struggling, it provides support and easier content."

### **"How is this different from Khan Academy/Duolingo?"**
→ "Those are reactive - you choose lessons and get feedback. Sunny is proactive - it creates a personalized learning path and adapts it continuously based on performance."

### **"What's the business model?"**
→ "Freemium - free basic access, premium for advanced features, parent dashboard, and multi-child support. Schools get group pricing."
